### Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project
-------------------------------------------

#### <ins>Brief Introduction</ins>

This project is based on one of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now, which is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website and also in the link given below, represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and we have to use this data for our project and perform some computations and processing on it.

#### <ins>Main Objective</ins>

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The main deliverables for this project are as follows.

	1) a tidy data set as described below
	2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
	3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
	4) a readme file namely README.md explaining how to run the script, what it does and how it works
